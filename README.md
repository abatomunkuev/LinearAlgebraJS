# LinearAlgebraJS JavaScript "library" for performing linear algebra calculations.

Personal project. I have an interest in Data Science. When I was learning linear algebra, I came up with an idea of building a JavaScript library to better understand the linear algebra. In this "library" you will find two classes: vector and matrix. Classes have methods to perform linear algebra calculations. In the future, I will imporve this library to make it more easier to use.
